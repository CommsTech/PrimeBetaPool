THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE!

Do not expect it to be perfect.
You can see a baseline LLD, and the use of the LLP.
This will help you in further pool development.

Contact me if you have bug fixes.

Note: The Web UI will be changed into JSON and created as it's own template packet, as integer serialization is limited by PHP's 32 signed integer maximum.
This repository will be changed / possibly removed in the future to be replaced with a fully LLL integrated pool server with functional web front end.
